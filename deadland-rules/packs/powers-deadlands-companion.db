Only one spirit may ride the voodooist at a time, though the caster may drop the spell at any time and start another if she chooses.</p>\n<p>When this power is cast, the voodooist invites the spirit into her body, giving her some of its personality (noted in each power). That loa remains for the entire Duration, and no other loa may be invited in until the previous spirit leaves.</p>\n<p>Using each ability is a free action unless it says otherwise.</p>\n<p><strong>Range:</strong> The voodooist can only cast this spell on herself, though the Range to any target is the caster's Spirit. This can't be increased with the Range Power Modifier since it's not the Range of the power itself.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AGWÉ:</strong> This loa rules over the great waters and all that dwells within them. He is most often depicted as a tall, handsome man with deep green eyes wearing formal clothes, crying salt tears for the slaves transported across the ocean during the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. Those ridden by Agwé are morose and easily brought to tears. <br>The spell allows the voodooist mastery of the water for the Duration of the power. She may walk upon it, breathe beneath its surface, and swim at her full Pace (plus running die if desired).</li>\n<li><strong>BARON SAMEDI: </strong>Samedi appears as a tall man in black hat, dark glasses, formal coat with tails, cotton plugs in his nose, and painted skull face. He is a dirty-minded and foul-mouthed loa who relishes human vices. Samedi is the loa of the dead and gatekeeper to the Hunting Grounds. Anyone possessed by the Baron becomes bawdy and salacious. <br>Samedi temporarily severs an undead creature's link to the Hunting Grounds. When cast successfully, it Stuns any creature with the Undead ability.</li>\n<li><strong>DAMBALLA: </strong>The ancient creator of the world once lay beneath the earth in serpent form. It was he who created the mountains and the skies and the seas and all that humanity beholds. He's a powerful, pristine loa who communicates messages of wealth, prosperity, and health through dreams. Casters who invite Damballa into their body become more patient and kind, with a long view to the cosmos and all who dwell in it. <br>You can reroll any Vigor roll for the Duration of the spell. If using the Wealth rules from Savage Worlds, you can also reroll any Wealth roll for the Duration of the spell. If not, reroll any Persuasion rolls to haggle or otherwise negotiate prices to get a better deal (a discount the GM feels is appropriate for the particular situation).</li>\n<li><strong>ERZULIE FRÉDA: </strong>Erzulie appears as a \"black Madonna,\" a loa of love and femininity. While beautiful and kind, she's also quick-tempered. When ridden by Erzulie, the voodooist also adopts these traits. <br>The power grants the hero a favor with a single individual who is romantically inclined toward his or her gender and has a Neutral or better Reaction (see the Reaction Table in Savage Worlds). This isn't the puppet power—the individual isn't a mind-controlled slave—he or she is just eager to please the houngan or mambo. The favor might be immediate such as providing information or a needed item, or it might be long term such as accompanying the mambo on a dangerous mission. Once the power expires, the target may rethink his or her commitment if confronted with a dangerous, difficult, embarrassing, or terrifying situation. Of course the voodooist can always channel Erzulie Fréda and rekindle the relationship anew.</li>\n<li><strong>PAPA LEGBA: </strong>Legba is the great communicator. He is depicted as an old man with a cane, wearing a broadrimmed straw hat and smoking a pipe, and is often accompanied by a loyal dog. When he rides an individual, she becomes more patient, wise, and sympathetic. <br>The houngan or mambo gets a free reroll on any Persuasion, Intimidation, or Taunt Tests for the Duration of the possession.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"equippable":false,"equipped":false,"actions":{"skill":"","skillMod":"","dmgMod":"","additional":{}},"rank":"Novice","pp":"5","damage":"","range":"Self","duration":"One Hour","trapping":"","arcane":"","skill":"","modifiers":[]},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.deadlands-rules.Powers-Deadlands-Companion.Ae8EopXUmkRH3nEV"}},"img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/power.svg","effects":[],"_id":"GXTFTXmq9CmAjv8b"}
