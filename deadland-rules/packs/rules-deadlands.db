{"name":"Duelin'","permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.deadlands-rules.Rules-Deadlands.DQnitsFkNaP8vCnO"}},"content":"<p>Truth be told, no special rules are required for duels. Two or more hombres can use the regular rules for a classic staredown. They can Test each other normally and draw down when they get just the right sequence of events in their favor, such as Testing someone one round and going first on the next before they lose any Distracted or Vulnerable condition.</p>\n<p>In the <em>legendary </em>West, however, slappin' leather is a sacred ritual and requires a bit more formality. And it almost always results in someone riding away in a pine box.</p>\n<p>Duels conducted in this way last exactly three rounds. Before the start of the first round, give each duelist a \"Hole Card,\" face down&mdash;don't let your rival see it! Some Edges add to the number of Hole Cards a pistoleer gets, so be wary of a gunslinger with a fist full of cards!</p>\n<p>On the first and second round, the bloodthirsty participants and any bystanders who might want to get involved are dealt an Action Card as usual. They can perform most actions (with a few exceptions noted below) except make an actual attack&mdash;that's reserved for the third and final round.</p>\n<h2>Tests</h2>\n<p>Distracted and Vulnerable conditions incurred during the duel remain until the <em>end </em>of the third round. A raise on a Test doesn't Shake a duelist, however. Instead, the \"attacker\" can either draw a new Hole Card for himself or force the foe to randomly discard one of his. Ignore this if it's his last card&mdash;everyone finishes with at least one. A Critical Failure when making or resisting a Test also gives the foe an additional Hole Card.</p>\n<p>Bystanders can Support an ally as usual. Testing a duelist's foe is frowned on and might even discredit the ally depending on how obvious it is, but can be done. Allies don't get to affect either duelist's Hole Card, however, and have no additional effect on a raise (the enemy isn't Shaken by Tests).</p>\n<p>Otherwise, all the usual Combat Options are available&mdash;except Aiming since no weapons have been drawn yet. (The Marksman Edge is perfectly legal, however.)</p>\n<h2>The Third Round</h2>\n<p>At the start of the third round, don't deal Action Cards to the duelists (deal bystanders in normally). Instead, both characters simultaneously reveal the Hole Card of their choice (usually the highest). That's their Action Card for this round, and determines who goes first.</p>\n<p>Duels are voluntary by frontier custom so firing first isn't generally considered murder. If a duelist doesn't want to shoot first though, he can let the other draw and try to interrupt him before he fires. See <strong>Hold </strong>in <em>Savage Worlds</em> for more, but a Joker doesn't <em>automatically </em>interrupt an action in a duel! It still adds +2 to the hero's Athletics roll, though.</p>\n<h2>Death &amp; Damage</h2>\n<p>If the attacker has one or more additional Hole Cards higher than his foe's Action Card, he adds a single d6 bonus die to the damage of the shooter's first shot. Ignore the bonus damage if he shoots more than once, whether he hits or not.</p>\n<p>The Grim Reaper loves a good duel and rewards the winner by making it a little less likely his opponent just Soaks the damage and fires back. For that reason, no one in a duel can Soak Wounds from anyone else in the duel. You gotta stand there and take it. It's the law of the West. You can Soak damage caused by low-down cheatin' varmints who <em>aren't</em> part of the throwdown, however.</p>\n<p>After the third round of the duel, treat the carnage and bloodshed as normal combat. Bystanders can join in, folks can Soak as they wish, and so on.</p>","_id":"YaDu3M9VsQRjQj6r"}

Unless otherwise noted, assume any locations within a geographic area share the general Fear Level.</p>\n<h2>Fear Penalty</h2>\n<p>The Fear Level inflicts a penalty to all Fear checks equal to &minus;1 for each Fear Level above 2, as shown below.

When the posse defeats a deadly abomination, captures a murderous outlaw gang, or rescues missing children, the heroes can round up the locals and give them hope by making a Persuasion roll for gripping oratory or rhetoric, or a Performance roll to sing a song, recite poetry, or dramatically narrate a rousing tale of the group's victory over the forces of evil.</p>\n<p>The epic needs to be recounted to a sizable audience&mdash;or at least an influential one, like the local press&mdash;and should always be accompanied by an actual recounting by one or more players. It must also be told within the area affected&mdash;an audience in Salt Lake City doesn't care so much what happens in Podunk, Montana.</p>\n<p>Don't penalize a player if he's not a good storyteller&mdash;that's his character's job, as reflected by his skill roll and the Tale-Teller Edge&mdash;but make him try. The Performance or Persuasion roll is modified by the Fear Level penalty and any other appropriate situational modifiers (his audience doesn't like him, most don't speak English, etc.). Multiple heroes may Support the storytelling. And you can certainly give an additional bonus of +1 or +2 if it's a really good tale. Edges that negate Fear penalties don't help here, though&mdash;that's a personal thing.</p>\n<p>With success the local Fear Level is reduced by 1. A Critical Failure on the Persuasion roll sends the wrong message and does little more than reinforce the notion that people should be afraid of the dark&mdash;the Fear Level actually increases by +1!</p>\n<p><strong>Conviction:</strong> When a hero with the TaleTeller Edge successfully lowers the local Fear Level, she and anyone who Supports her automatically gain Conviction. This is a major event that steels a posse's resolve.</p>\n<h2>Fear in Your Game</h2>\n<p>It's been said fear is the oldest and most primal of human emotions. That may be true, but those of us with any experience running roleplaying games know it's notoriously difficult to scare players in a horror game.</p>\n<p>Every once in a while an evocative description might garner a whispered, \"Creepy&hellip;\" but most of the time you're up against a barrage of jokes, pop-culture references, and dice-fueled bravado.</p>\n<p>It's easy to make players roll Fear checks and tell them how terrified their characters are when they fail. What's a little more challenging is making your jaded, seenit-all-and-then-some roleplayers feel a little of that dread themselves. You've got to let them use their imagination. The unknown is the only thing that can cause true apprehension at the table.</p>\n<p>In other words, wait a little bit before the beastie jumps out of the tall grass and bites down on some poor cowpoke's head. Describe the whispering of the wind through the grass, and the way the clouds cast malformed shadows on the earth. Create a little tension. Don't let the posse get a clear look at what they're up against. Draw out the suspense long enough and your players might just have their heroes run for the hills.</p>\n<p>If your riders are traveling the Chisholm Trail and you roll up a hangin' judge, don't just have the spook leap out at the posse and start blazing away. Maybe at night, one hero hears a mysterious voice whisper his \"crimes\"&mdash;and a few of his deepest secrets. All the next day, the posse is stalked by a strange figure on the horizon. The following night, the hangin' judge drifts into camp while the lone hero is on watch and attempts to hang him, and the rest of the posse must struggle to save their comrade from a grisly death, despite not having the appropriate tools to knock off the abomination.</p>","_id":"dhvfUworvSXuX50v"}

The people are friendly, the sky is blue, and even the little ones can safely walk the streets at night. Only a few of these places are left in the Weird West, and they ain't easy to find.</p>\n<p><strong>Fear Level 1:</strong> The locals believe monsters exist, they just haven't seen any. The sky is still blue, but if you must go out at night, best bring a buddy.</p>\n<p><strong>Fear Level 2: </strong>No one goes near the creepy old shack on top of the hill. The land looks about the same, but the shadows are just a little bit longer. It's not really safe to go out alone at night, but your odds are good. This is the prevailing Fear Level in most places these days.</p>\n<p><strong>Fear Level 3:</strong> Things are starting to get a little weird. There's an occasional disappearance, and probably more than a few weird creatures live close by (though folks don't really talk about them). Don't go out at night without a weapon or a friend.</p>\n<p><strong>Fear Level 4: </strong>There are mysterious disappearances, and when the bodies are found, it's piece by piece. The land itself starts to change: the shadows on the cliffs start to look like leering faces, or cornrows always seem to rustle as if something's hiding within. The winds of the High Plains might whisper your name&hellip;and not in a friendly way.</p>\n<p><strong>Fear Level 5:</strong> There's no doubt something's amiss. Folks have seen monsters, and almost everyone's terrified. Most flowers die, but weeds have no problem thriving. Don't go out at night without an armed posse.</p>\n<p><strong>Fear Level 6 (Deadland): </strong>This is as bad as it gets, Marshal&mdash;a full-blown nightmare landscape. Monsters run rampant, rocks look like skulls&mdash;and just might be! Not only do the winds of the High Plains whisper your name here, they do so in your dead friend's voice. Anyone out at night is dead meat. If the Reckoners have their way, the whole planet is destined to one day become such a place.</p>","_id":"332ti4LmhRRGBoab"}
{"name":"Superstition","permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Q6DYNph5IAC7JPLP"}},"content":"<p>After 21 solid years of living with the Reckoning's daily horrors, people are more superstitious than ever. After all, some folks say monsters are real! Here we give you two ways to simulate this state of affairs, Marshal.</p>\n<h2>Suspicion</h2>\n<p>In a small town, everyone knows everyone else and are soon aware of a stranger's arrival. These days one can't be too careful, especially with all these drifters in their peculiar get-ups, and those <em>things </em>lurkin' out there in the dark.</p>\n<p>Whenever your posse arrives in a new town, apply a &minus;2 penalty to rolls on the <strong>Reaction Table</strong> (in <em>Savage Worlds</em>) until the cowpokes can ingratiate themselves and prove they mean no harm. This takes a day or two at least, barring some overwhelming act of bravery, heroism, or charity.</p>\n<h2>Superstition</h2>\n<p>Most townsfolk in the Weird West are Godfearing folk who view magic as the work of Satan. When folks see something undeniably strange, they tend to run from it. Word spreads quickly, and if it's scary enough a mob gathers with as much rope as it can find, whether the local law's on board or not.</p>\n<p>Obvious displays of magic, deathly looking folks who smell of rot, voodoo rituals, weird critters, and all such odd occurrences fit the bill. And of course someone who knows what they're looking for can spot a huckster or a witch from a country mile.</p>","_id":"WdTIeACaXEy2kr2c"}
{"name":"Dealing with the Devil for Metal Mages","permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.dK5M4r56wWMn81Id"}},"content":"<ol>\n<li><strong>Ante Up: </strong>The hero must spend a Benny to deal with the devil, just like a huckster. Dealing with the Devil is an action that includes casting the spell, but can only be done once per turn.</li>\n<li><strong>Choose a Power: </strong>The character can cast any power available to mad scientists, including those he doesn't have or that are above his Rank. Total up the Power Points it requires, including any Modifiers.</li>\n<li><strong>Make an Occult Roll: </strong>Metal mages don't gamble with manitous, they open their minds to the spirits' mad whispers to create fantastic but temporary devices. Draw five cards from a fresh deck of cards, then make an Occult roll and draw one extra card for success or two with a raise. Failure means you get no additional cards. A Critical Failure means you get no additional cards, and after the spell is resolved, the Marshal rolls on the <strong>Huckster's Backfire Table</strong> in <em>Deadlands</em>. <br /><br />Metal Mages can't take Huckster Edges and so can't get extra cards from them when Dealing with the Devil, but they get an extra card if they have at least 20 pounds of loose metal parts within arm's reach. They may also draw an additional card if they offer up an ounce of ghost rock (consumed in the process).</li>\n<li><strong>Make a Poker Hand: </strong>Once the mage has all his cards, put together the best poker hand you can manage and consult the <strong>Dealing with the Devil Table </strong>in <em>Deadlands</em>. Jokers are Wild Cards that can be used as any other card, and you get your ante (Benny) back! <br /><br />You can only use the Power Points granted by the hand&mdash;not the character's pool&mdash; when Dealing with the Devil. The metal mage still attempts to cast the spell even if he didn't get enough Power Points, as you'll see in the next step.</li>\n<li><strong>Activate the Device: </strong>Now make a Weird Science roll. Subtract 2 for each level the power is above the character's current Rank, if any, and one for each Power Point you came up short in the last step. If the hand gave you more Power Points than you needed, you can add them to the Weird Science roll to increase the total, or replenish your existing Power Point pool (this can't exceed the character's maximum). <br /><br />Failure means you've lost your ante and the power fails. Critical Failure means the power fails and the Marshal rolls on the <strong>Huckster's Backfire Table</strong> (see <em>Deadlands</em>).</li>\n<li><strong>Resolve the Power: </strong>If the power was successful, resolve its effects as usual.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Example: Doc Gordan &amp; The Arachnoids!</h2>\n<p>Doc Samantha \"Sam\" Gordon needs to cast <em>blast</em> to fend off a wave of deadly clockwork spiders. She doesn't have that particular power so she must Deal with the Devil. She antes up a Benny and makes an Occult roll. She gets one success, so that's one extra card. She's in a scrapyard full of metal so she gets an extra card for that, and commits an ounce of ghost rock for one more card. That's eight cards total. She draws, and with a Joker, gets a Full House! The Joker gives her the ante back, and a Full House gives her 10 Power Points and double damage!</p>\n<p>Sam needs three Power Points for the spell and adds Selective (+1), Area Effect (Large Blast Template, +1), and Damage (+2) for a total of seven Power Points. She keeps the remaining three Power Points from her Full House as a bonus to the roll, countering the &minus;2 for it being a Rank above her (she's a Novice) with +1 to spare. She rolls her Weird Science skill and with the bonus gets an 8! The spiders vanish in a wave of jagged metal for a whopping 4d6 damage&mdash;doubled after rolling for the Full House!</p>\n</blockquote>","_id":"zh2jcLHeujUzexls"}
{"name":"Gear on the Cheap","permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.RGmPJG0xGfn4EaGf"}},"content":"<p>Most anything in this chapter, excepting services, can be bought secondhand for half the listed price. Common items such as clothes are ratty and torn, hats are crumpled, and dinged-up playing cards can't be used anywhere except by the campfire. These effects are usually situational, which means some items cause bigger problems than others (at the Marshal's discretion).</p>\n<h2>El Cheapo Gear</h2>\n<p><strong>Cost:</strong> El cheapo gear costs half the normal price, but a cowpoke only receives a discount on types of gear described below.</p>\n<p><strong>Breakage:</strong> Cheap guns, saddles, and so forth&mdash;anything a cowpoke might use in a Trait roll&mdash;break if the player rolls a Critical Failure. An el cheapo tomahawk falls apart while you're trying to whack some nogood rascal, or a secondhand wagon loses a wheel. If your cowpoke has the All Thumbs Hindrance, the breakage is spectacular enough to Stun the user. Powered items explode, the cinch on a saddle snaps like thunder, and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>Persuasion Penalties: </strong>Items that don't come into play for skill rolls might affect folks' perception of your hero. A ratty duster, for example, is a sure sign of a no-good scofflaw or saddletramp in civilized company&mdash;even in the most remote corners of the West. Each of these items inflicts a &minus;1 modifier to your hombre's Persuasion rolls, but the maximum penalty for el cheapo gear is &minus;2.</p>\n<h2>El Cheapo Horses</h2>\n<p>Skinflint characters who cheap out on horseflesh are in for a whole different brand of trouble. El cheapo horses, in addition to their normal statistics, have two Minor Hindrances or a Major Hindrance of the Marshal's choice. That's right, partner, you could wind up with an Elderly nag, a Stubborn mare, or a Mean stallion full of piss and vinegar. You pays your money (or not) and you takes your chances.</p>\n<p>Marshal, we know how much you want to punish your players for being misers, but use common sense here. Horses don't make the kind of Enemies that call them out for a duel at High Noon, and they're about as likely to be outlaws as Johnny Ringo is to join a sewing circle. That said, an ornery horse might hate a particular appaloosa in the posse, or an \"outlaw\" horse might have been stolen and had its brand altered.</p>","_id":"SHrH254MsmWhL1YQ"}
