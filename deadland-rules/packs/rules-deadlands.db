{"name":"Duelin'","permission":{"default":0,"rbcGjlrp2ErJQnBu":3},"flags":{},"content":"<p>Truth be told, no special rules are required for duels. Two or more hombres can use the regular rules for a classic staredown. They can Test each other normally and draw down when they get just the right sequence of events in their favor, such as Testing someone one round and going first on the next before they lose any Distracted or Vulnerable condition.</p>\n<p>In the <em>legendary </em>West, however, slappin' leather is a sacred ritual and requires a bit more formality. And it almost always results in someone riding away in a pine box.</p>\n<p>Duels conducted in this way last exactly three rounds. Before the start of the first round, give each duelist a \"Hole Card,\" face down&mdash;don't let your rival see it! Some Edges add to the number of Hole Cards a pistoleer gets, so be wary of a gunslinger with a fist full of cards!</p>\n<p>On the first and second round, the bloodthirsty participants and any bystanders who might want to get involved are dealt an Action Card as usual. They can perform most actions (with a few exceptions noted below) except make an actual attack&mdash;that's reserved for the third and final round.</p>\n<h2>Tests</h2>\n<p>Distracted and Vulnerable conditions incurred during the duel remain until the <em>end </em>of the third round. A raise on a Test doesn't Shake a duelist, however. Instead, the \"attacker\" can either draw a new Hole Card for himself or force the foe to randomly discard one of his. Ignore this if it's his last card&mdash;everyone finishes with at least one. A Critical Failure when making or resisting a Test also gives the foe an additional Hole Card.</p>\n<p>Bystanders can Support an ally as usual. Testing a duelist's foe is frowned on and might even discredit the ally depending on how obvious it is, but can be done. Allies don't get to affect either duelist's Hole Card, however, and have no additional effect on a raise (the enemy isn't Shaken by Tests).</p>\n<p>Otherwise, all the usual Combat Options are available&mdash;except Aiming since no weapons have been drawn yet. (The Marksman Edge is perfectly legal, however.)</p>\n<h2>The Third Round</h2>\n<p>At the start of the third round, don't deal Action Cards to the duelists (deal bystanders in normally). Instead, both characters simultaneously reveal the Hole Card of their choice (usually the highest). That's their Action Card for this round, and determines who goes first.</p>\n<p>Duels are voluntary by frontier custom so firing first isn't generally considered murder. If a duelist doesn't want to shoot first though, he can let the other draw and try to interrupt him before he fires. See <strong>Hold </strong>in <em>Savage Worlds</em> for more, but a Joker doesn't <em>automatically </em>interrupt an action in a duel! It still adds +2 to the hero's Athletics roll, though.</p>\n<h2>Death &amp; Damage</h2>\n<p>If the attacker has one or more additional Hole Cards higher than his foe's Action Card, he adds a single d6 bonus die to the damage of the shooter's first shot. Ignore the bonus damage if he shoots more than once, whether he hits or not.</p>\n<p>The Grim Reaper loves a good duel and rewards the winner by making it a little less likely his opponent just Soaks the damage and fires back. For that reason, no one in a duel can Soak Wounds from anyone else in the duel. You gotta stand there and take it. It's the law of the West. You can Soak damage caused by low-down cheatin' varmints who <em>aren't</em> part of the throwdown, however.</p>\n<p>After the third round of the duel, treat the carnage and bloodshed as normal combat. Bystanders can join in, folks can Soak as they wish, and so on.</p>","_id":"DQnitsFkNaP8vCnO"}
