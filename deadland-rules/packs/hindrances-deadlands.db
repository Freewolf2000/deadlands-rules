Worse, anytime his attack roll is a Critical Failure, he hits the nearest ally in sight with a raise! This happens whether the target's in the line of fire or not. Maybe the killer's gun hand gets jostled, the bullet ricochets, or he catches flying shrapnel from an explosion. Other players' characters are always first choice, but any friendly soul will do in a pinch.</p>\n<p>Even hand-to-hand attacks hit allies when a Grim Servant o' Death gets violent. This may require a little imagination, but either the weapon flies out of the hero's hand and strikes his friend, or the hero moves adjacent to his erstwhile comrade and \"accidentally\" whacks him.
